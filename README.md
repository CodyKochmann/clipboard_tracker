# clipboard_tracker
Python clipboard logger for OSX

This was created to give me a portable log of all of my clipboard activity so everything that I thought was worth copying is saved. There are other applications out there that already do this but I wanted something solid, lightweight, and simple.

To Do List:
- [ ] create an exporter of that builds a webpage to interact with the clips
- [ ] add encryption to the CSV file
- [ ] add a CSV optimizer that removes duplicates from being entered

Considering:
- merging the CSV file and the script file for one portable script
- adding support for Linux
- adding a delete function
- adding a command line interface
